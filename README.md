This project has been created as part of the 42 curriculum by aouaalla.

# Description
CPP Module 04 follows the series of CPP Modules, this one focuses on the concept of Sub-typing polymorphism, Abstract classes and interfaces.

# Instructions
This project follows the basic compilation of C/C++!

## Compilation
Make within each exercise and execute each's corresponding program.

## ex00/
This exercise implements a simple class hierarchy (`Animal`, `Dog`, `Cat`) to demonstrate subtype polymorphism using virtual functions. It also includes `WrongAnimal` and `WrongCat` to contrast with non-polymorphic behavior.

Usage:
```bash
./poly
```

## ex01/
This exercise adds a `Brain` class to `Dog` and `Cat` and implements deep copy to manage memory correctly.

Usage:
```bash
make
./poly
```

## ex02/
This exercise modifies `Animal` to be an abstract class, preventing it from being instantiated directly.

Usage:
```bash
make
./poly
```
